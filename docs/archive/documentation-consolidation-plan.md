# Documentation Consolidation Plan

## Prerequisites

- [Add prerequisites here]

## Steps


**Created:** November 27, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Completed (January 2026)
**Purpose:** Consolidate `.kiro/` into `docs/` for simpler documentation structure

> **Note:** This consolidation has been completed. The `.kiro/` and `.docs/` directories no longer exist. All documentation is now in `/docs/`.

---

## Executive Summary

Currently the project has **three separate documentation structures**:
1. `/docs/` - Main technical documentation
2. `/.kiro/` - Kiro spec-driven documentation (hidden directory)
3. `/.docs/` - Admin fixes documentation (hidden directory)

**Recommendation:** Consolidate all documentation into a single `/docs/` directory.
