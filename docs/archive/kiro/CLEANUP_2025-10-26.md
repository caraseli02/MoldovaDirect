# Documentation Cleanup - October 26, 2025

## Summary

Completed comprehensive review and organization of markdown documentation files across the repository. Moved outdated summaries and completed work documentation to appropriate archive locations.

## Files Moved to Archive

### Supabase Documentation (`.kiro/archive/supabase/`)
- ✅ `SUPABASE_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Initial audit from October 25, 2025 (superseded by best practices audit)
- ✅ `SUPABASE_FIXES_COMPLETED.md` - Completed Supabase module migration summary
- ✅ `SUPABASE_BEST_PRACTICES_AUDIT_2025-10-25.md` - Detailed audit and fixes

**Reason:** These documents record completed work. The best practices are now documented in `.kiro/steering/supabase-best-practices.md` for ongoing reference.

### Admin Documentation (`.kiro/archive/admin/`)
- ✅ `ADMIN_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive admin features review from October 26, 2025

**Reason:** This was a point-in-time review. Current admin status is tracked in `README.md` and `.kiro/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

### Summary Documents (`.kiro/archive/summaries/`)
- ✅ `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation updates from October 12, 2025
- ✅ `CLEANUP_COMPLETED_2025-10-12.md` - Code cleanup summary from October 12, 2025
- ✅ `CODE_CLEANUP_ANALYSIS_2025-10-26.md` - Detailed cleanup analysis from October 26, 2025

**Reason:** These are historical summaries of completed work. Ongoing cleanup tracking is in `CODE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md`.

### Documentation Files (`.kiro/archive/docs/`)
- ✅ `AGENTS.md` - Repository guidelines (content duplicated in `.kiro/steering/` files)

**Reason:** Content is better organized in the steering files. `CLAUDE.md` remains as the primary developer guide.

## Files Deleted

### Redundant Documentation
- ✅ `ORDERS_UI_COMPLETE.md` - Orders UI completion summary
- ✅ `SETUP_ORDERS_DATA.md` - Orders data setup guide

**Reason:** Information is now consolidated in `.kiro/specs/admin-order-management/README.md` and related spec files.

## Files Kept in Root

### Essential Documentation
- ✅ `README.md` - Main project README
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Primary developer guide for AI assistants
- ✅ `TODO.md` - Active task tracking
- ✅ `CODE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` - Ongoing cleanup tracking

**Reason:** These are actively maintained and frequently referenced.

## Documentation Organization Principles

### What Stays in Root
- Main README
- Developer guides (CLAUDE.md)
- Active task tracking (TODO.md)
- Ongoing reports (CODE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md)

### What Goes to Archive
- Completed work summaries
- Point-in-time reviews
- Historical audits
- Superseded documentation

### What Goes to `.kiro/specs/`
- Feature specifications
- Implementation details
- Task breakdowns
- Design documents

### What Goes to `.kiro/steering/`
- Coding conventions
- Best practices
- Project structure guidelines
- Technology standards

### What Goes to `docs/`
- Architecture documentation
- System design
- Integration guides
- Active technical documentation

## Impact

### Before Cleanup
- 14 markdown files in root directory
- Mix of active and historical documentation
- Unclear which docs were current

### After Cleanup
- 4 essential markdown files in root
- Clear separation of active vs. historical docs
- Organized archive structure

### Benefits
- ✅ Easier to find current documentation
- ✅ Historical context preserved in archive
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load for developers
- ✅ Clear documentation hierarchy

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [x] Move outdated summaries to archive
- [x] Delete redundant documentation
- [x] Create cleanup summary

### Ongoing
- [ ] Review docs quarterly for archival candidates
- [ ] Update `CODE_CLEANUP_REPORT.md` as work progresses
- [ ] Keep `TODO.md` current with completed tasks
- [ ] Archive completion summaries promptly
