## Executive Summary

**Overall Status:** PASSED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

The visual regression testing setup has successfully captured baseline screenshots for 13 critical pages. The screenshots are valid and correctly capture the application state. The extremely tall screenshots (homepage-mobile: 11,940px, products-mobile: 9,762px) are **NOT BUGS** but reflect the actual content-rich nature of the pages.

**Confidence Level:** 85% - Baselines are usable, but missing some important test coverage.
