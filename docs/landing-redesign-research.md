## 🎯 Executive Summary

### TL;DR: Recommended Design Direction

**PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: "To'ak Chocolate + Brightland" Hybrid Approach**

For Moldova Direct's wine, gourmet food, and traditional crafts e-commerce, the winning combination is:

1. **To'ak Chocolate's luxury storytelling** (heritage, artisanal quality, origin stories)
2. **Brightland's press credibility bar** (editorial trust signals)
3. **Olipop's product carousel** (featured products with benefits)
4. **Rhode Skin's authentic founder videos** (humanizing the brand)

**WHY THIS WORKS FOR MOLDOVA DIRECT:**
- Both To'ak and Brightland excel in **premium food/beverage positioning**
- Heritage and origin storytelling align perfectly with Moldova's **traditional crafts narrative**
- Press credibility builds immediate trust for **international customers**
- Video testimonials can showcase **Moldovan winemakers and artisans** authentically
- Product carousels highlight **curated collections** without overwhelming visitors

**AVOID:**
- Gymshark's athletic/fast-fashion approach (wrong industry)
- Beardbrand's masculine grooming aesthetic (not aligned)
- Aggressive quiz-first strategies (save for later in funnel)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation for Vue 3/Nuxt 3

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-lazy-load'],
  // Performance optimization
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      crawlLinks: true
    }
  }
})
```

```vue
<!-- components/landing/VideoHero.vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'

const videoSources = {
  mobile: '/videos/hero-mobile.mp4',
  tablet: '/videos/hero-tablet.mp4',
  desktop: '/videos/hero-desktop.mp4'
}

const isVideoLoaded = ref(false)

const handleCanPlayThrough = () => {
  isVideoLoaded.value = true
}
</script>

<template>
  <section class="relative h-screen w-full overflow-hidden">
    <!-- Video Background -->
    <video
      autoplay
      muted
      loop
      playsinline
      class="absolute inset-0 h-full w-full object-cover"
      @canplaythrough="handleCanPlayThrough"
    >
      <source :src="videoSources.mobile" media="(max-width: 767px)" type="video/mp4">
      <source :src="videoSources.tablet" media="(max-width: 1023px)" type="video/mp4">
      <source :src="videoSources.desktop" type="video/mp4">

}

/* Body Text */
body {
  font-family: var(--font-sans);
  font-size: var(--text-base);  /* 16px */
  line-height: var(--leading-relaxed);
  color: var(--color-neutral-600);
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  h1 { font-size: var(--text-4xl); }  /* 36px on mobile */
  h2 { font-size: var(--text-3xl); }  /* 30px on mobile */
}
```

### Spacing System

**8-Point Grid System:**
```css
:root {
  --space-0: 0;
  --space-1: 0.25rem;   /* 4px */
  --space-2: 0.5rem;    /* 8px */
  --space-3: 0.75rem;   /* 12px */
  --space-4: 1rem;      /* 16px - Base unit */
  --space-5: 1.25rem;   /* 20px */
  --space-6: 1.5rem;    /* 24px */
  --space-8: 2rem;      /* 32px */
  --space-10: 2.5rem;   /* 40px */
  --space-12: 3rem;     /* 48px */
  --space-16: 4rem;     /* 64px */
  --space-20: 5rem;     /* 80px */
  --space-24: 6rem;     /* 96px */
  --space-32: 8rem;     /* 128px */
}
```

**Usage Guidelines:**
- **Micro spacing (4-8px):** Between related elements (icon + text, form fields)
- **Component spacing (16-24px):** Padding inside cards, buttons, sections
- **Section spacing (48-96px):** Between major page sections
- **Hero spacing (96-128px):** Large breathing room for hero sections

### Border Radius

```css
:root {
  --radius-none: 0;
  --radius-sm: 0.25rem;   /* 4px - Subtle rounding */
  --radius-md: 0.5rem;    /* 8px - Buttons, inputs */
  --radius-lg: 1rem;      /* 16px - Cards */
  --radius-xl: 1.5rem;    /* 24px - Large cards */
  --radius-2xl: 2rem;     /* 32px - Hero sections */
  --radius-full: 9999px;  /* Full circle */
}
```

**Usage:**
- **sm (4px):** Badges, tags
- **md (8px):** Buttons, inputs, small cards
- **lg (16px):** Product cards, modals
- **xl (24px):** Large hero cards, feature sections
- **full:** Avatars, circular buttons

### Shadow System

```css
:root {
  /* Elevation Shadows */
  --shadow-xs: 0 1px 2px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05);
  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 1px 2px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 2px 4px -2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px -5px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 8px 10px -6px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
  --shadow-2xl: 0 25px 50px -12px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.25);

  /* Inner Shadow */
  --shadow-inner: inset 0 2px 4px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05);

  /* No Shadow */
  --shadow-none: 0 0 #0000;
}
```

**Usage:**
- **xs-sm:** Subtle depth for inputs, tags
- **md:** Cards, dropdowns
- **lg-xl:** Modals, floating elements
- **2xl:** Hero sections, feature highlights
- **inner:** Pressed button states, active inputs

### Animation Durations

```css
:root {
  /* Timing */
  --duration-fast: 150ms;     /* Micro-interactions */
  --duration-normal: 300ms;   /* Standard transitions */
  --duration-slow: 500ms;     /* Emphasized transitions */
  --duration-slower: 700ms;   /* Modal entrances */

  /* Easing Functions */
  --ease-in: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1);
  --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1);
  --ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
  --ease-bounce: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55);
}
```

**Usage Guidelines:**
```css
/* Hover States */
.button {
  transition: all var(--duration-fast) var(--ease-out);
}

/* Modal Entrances */
.modal-enter-active {
  transition: all var(--duration-slower) var(--ease-out);
}

/* Carousel Slides */

  transition: transform var(--duration-normal) var(--ease-in-out);
}
```
