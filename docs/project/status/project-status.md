## 📝 Remaining Action Items

### Code Quality (HIGH - Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Refactor Products Page** - Split 915-line component into smaller modules
   - **Phase 1 (2-3 days):** Add safety net tests FIRST
     - Create page integration tests (`tests/pages/products/index.test.ts`)
     - Add composable unit tests for `useProductFilters`, `useProductSearch`, `useProductCatalog`
     - Add snapshot tests for current behavior
     - **Current Gap:** 9 product composables have NO tests (93% untested)
   - **Phase 2 (4 days):** Refactor with confidence
     - Extract components (Filters, SearchBar, Grid, Pagination)
     - Extract composables with test coverage
     - Reduce main page to <200 lines
   - **Total Effort:** 6-7 days
   - **Risk:** HIGH without Phase 1 tests (subtle bugs in filter/search logic)

2. **Split Auth Store** - Break 1,172-line store into focused modules

3. **Add API Authorization** - Secondary authorization checks at API route level

### Testing (MEDIUM - Next Month)
1. **Expand Unit Test Coverage** - Target 80% coverage for composables
2. **Add E2E Auth Tests** - Comprehensive authentication flow testing
3. **Performance Testing** - Load testing for admin dashboard and checkout
