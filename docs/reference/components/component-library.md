# Moldova Direct - Component Library

## Prerequisites

## Steps


## Overview

The project uses a **localized component system** in `components/ui/`. These components are built on the **shadcn-vue pattern** and utilize **Reka UI** (a headless UI primitive library) for industry-standard accessibility. 

Because the source code resides directly in your project, it is considered a "custom" library—allowing for critical bug fixes (e.g., v-model reactivity fixes) and design customizations that wouldn't be possible with a standard external dependency.
