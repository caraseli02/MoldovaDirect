# 🔴 CRITICAL: Rotate Exposed Supabase Service Key

## Problem Statement

A **real, valid Supabase service role key** is exposed in version control in the `.env.example` file. This key grants full database access and bypasses Row Level Security (RLS).

**Location:** `/Users/vladislavcaraseli/Documents/MoldovaDirect/.env.example:5`

```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImtodnpiamVteWRkZG5yeXJleXR1Iiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjQ1NCwiZXhwIjoyMDcxMzYyNDU0fQ.li8R9uS_JdRP4AgUjw31v5z-jRFhySa-GHC1Qu0AEXI
```

**Decoded JWT:**
- Project: `khvzbjemdddnryreyu`
- Role: `service_role` (full admin access)
- Expires: 2035 (long-lived)

## Impact

- **CRITICAL RISK**: Anyone with repository access can perform ANY database operation
- Can read, modify, or delete all data
- Can bypass all Row Level Security policies
- Can create/drop tables and modify schema
- Key is valid until 2035 unless manually revoked

## Findings

**Discovered by:** security-sentinel agent during code review
**Review date:** 2025-11-01
**Exploitability:** IMMEDIATE - Key is usable right now
**OWASP Category:** A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Immediate Rotation (REQUIRED)

**Steps:**
1. **Rotate the key in Supabase dashboard:**
   - Go to Project Settings → API
   - Regenerate service_role key
   - Copy new key to password manager

2. **Update all environments:**
   - Update Vercel environment variables
   - Update local `.env` files (all team members)
   - Update any CI/CD secrets

3. **Revoke old key:**
   - Verify new key works
   - Revoke old key in Supabase dashboard

4. **Fix .env.example:**
   ```env
   # Replace line 5 with:
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```

5. **Audit access logs:**
   - Check Supabase logs for unauthorized access
   - Review database audit logs for suspicious queries

**Pros:**
- Eliminates immediate security risk
- Industry standard practice
- Simple to execute

**Cons:**
- Requires coordination with team
- Temporary disruption if not coordinated

**Effort:** Small (30 minutes)
**Risk:** Low (if coordinated properly)

### Option 2: Implement Secret Management (RECOMMENDED for long-term)

After immediate rotation, implement proper secret management:

1. Use Vercel Environment Variables for all secrets
2. Add git-secrets or similar pre-commit hooks
3. Implement secret rotation policy (quarterly)
4. Use different keys per environment (dev/staging/prod)

**Pros:**
- Prevents future credential exposure
- Enables secret rotation
- Better security hygiene

**Cons:**
- Requires setup time
- Team training needed

**Effort:** Medium (2-3 hours)
**Risk:** Low

## Recommended Action

**IMMEDIATE (within 1 hour):**
1. Rotate the exposed key in Supabase
2. Update all environments with new key
3. Fix .env.example to remove real key
4. Commit fix with message: "security: remove exposed service key from .env.example"

**THIS WEEK:**
5. Audit Supabase access logs for unauthorized usage
6. Implement git-secrets pre-commit hook
7. Document secret management process

## Technical Details

- **Affected Files:**
  - `.env.example` (line 5)
  - Potentially `.env` if it was copied from example

- **Related Components:**
  - All server-side code using Supabase
  - Database operations
  - Authentication flows

- **Database Changes:** None required

## Resources

- Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/khvzbjemdddnryreyu/settings/api
- Vercel Environment Variables: https://vercel.com/moldovadirect/settings/environment-variables
- Git-secrets: https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets
- OWASP A02:2021: https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New service key generated in Supabase
- [ ] Old key revoked
- [ ] All environments updated with new key
- [ ] .env.example contains placeholder, not real key
- [ ] Verified application still works with new key
- [ ] Access logs audited for suspicious activity
- [ ] No real secrets remain in version control
- [ ] Team notified of key rotation

## Work Log

### 2025-11-01 - Code Review Discovery
**By:** Claude Code Review System (security-sentinel agent)
**Actions:**
- Discovered during comprehensive e2e test infrastructure security audit
- Analyzed and confirmed key is real and valid
- Categorized as P0 critical security issue

**Learnings:**
- .env.example files should NEVER contain real credentials
- Service role keys are especially dangerous as they bypass RLS
- Git history should be checked to ensure real .env was never committed

## Notes

**URGENT:** This is a P0 critical security issue. Address immediately before any other work.

**Git History Check:**
```bash
# Check if real .env was ever committed
git log --all --full-history -- .env

# If found, consider using git-filter-repo to remove from history
# https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo
```

**Communication:**
- Notify team via Slack/email about key rotation
- Provide new key through secure channel (1Password, etc.)
- Update team documentation with new secret management process
